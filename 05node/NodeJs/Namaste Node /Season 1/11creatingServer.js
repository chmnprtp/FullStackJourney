// ec2 instance is a server

// A server is a system that listens for requests and responds with the required data or service.

//! Why don't I use my own laptop as a server?
// My laptop has limited RAM and storage, and can't scale to handle traffic or load.
// AWS provides scalable infrastructure that can automatically grow with demand.

//! Create a server
// const http = require("node:http"); //because it a core module
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{ // these are two object which have some methods
    
    if(req.url === "/bye"){
        res.end("Don't Go!")
    }
    res.end("Hello User");

}); // it gives instance of server
server.listen(7777,()=>{
    console.log("Go to Browser");
