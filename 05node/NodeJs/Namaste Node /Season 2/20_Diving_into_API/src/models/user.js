//! Model
// ðŸ”· What is a Model?
// A model is a constructor function created from a schema. 
// It is used to create and interact with documents in a collection.

// You can think of a model as a tool or class that lets you read, write, update, 
// and delete documents in MongoDB using that schema.


//! Document
/*
ðŸ“„ What is a Document?

A document is a single record in MongoDB. It's stored in JSON-like format (specifically, BSON â€” Binary JSON).

ðŸ”¹ Itâ€™s like a row in a SQL database, but more flexible.
ðŸ”§ Example:
{
  "_id": "665fa0158a76e65c205c1d2a",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "age": 25
}
_id: A unique identifier automatically added by MongoDB
Fields can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, dates, etc.

//! Collection
/*
ðŸ“¦ What is a Collection?

A collection is a group of documents â€” similar to a table in SQL.

ðŸ”¹ All documents in a collection are stored together, but donâ€™t need to have the exact same fields or structure.
ðŸ”§ Example:
You might have a collection called users:

users
 â”œâ”€â”€ { "_id": ..., "name": "Alice", "email": ... }
 â”œâ”€â”€ { "_id": ..., "name": "Bob", "email": ..., "age": 30 }
 â””â”€â”€ { "_id": ..., "name": "Carol" }
Each document can look different, but they live in the same collection.

//! __v - when we update data , it maintain version of it
//! _id - whenever you add any data to mongodb , mongodb automatically created it
