        ? What is crossorigin?
        --The crossorigin attribute is used in HTML to control how resources (such as images, scripts, stylesheets, or fonts) are fetched from different origins (domains) in a way that respects the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
        --CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers to prevent unauthorized requests from one domain to another.
